# noRunningForQueue
A little coding project to improve my programming skills

Works by using the [League Client Update API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#league-client-api) and accessing it via the lockfile.

To run this program you may need to add [this offical certificate](https://static.developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol/riotgames.pem) 
Additionally the program will not run if League itself is not running. 
__This program does not use or need your username and password__
